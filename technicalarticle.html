    <header>What is Psuedocoding?</header>
    <p>Psuedocode is basically a thorough detailed description of what our project will be. There will be no coding. but basically step by step of what we plan to do! If we can 
      explain it in detail in our "rough draft" then we will be able to implement what we just described into of coding step by step. 
      I love doing psuedocode to do my work. Although I'm still getting a hang of it, It helps me break down everything and slow down my thinking so that I can figure out step by step how to do a problem 
    and be able to explain it efficiently. I practice using psuedocoding while doing my Katas on codewars and I have gotten so much better at those just by writing everything down. It's amazing how just 
    a few weeks ago, this was all "blah blah blah" to me and now- the growth from then till now is immaculate! So i'm very pumped for what is yet to come for me on this journey. </p>
