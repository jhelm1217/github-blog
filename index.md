<h3> Hi, I have two cats! a Gray Tabby named Poppa, my cuddle big baby and a crazy, sassy and wild tortieshell named Ja'ci who keeps me on my toes. And yes.... she's named after me. lol </h3>

<h3> Was your first week what you expected? Why or why not? </h3>
<h5> Honestly, yes, I knew for a fact that I was going to experience 18 different emotions in a day! LOL. The material was going to be a bit challenging, but I knew with patience and staying gentle with myself throughout this journey, I would be fine. I'm used to not asking for help, so this is really making me step out of my comfort zone. </h5>

<h5> I'm actually eager to learn just about everything. I love the CSS and styling, that looks pretty fun so I want to learn more about that. Since I am fairly new to , I would like to see which section I would like more than the others, such as front end, back end etc. </h5>

<h3> What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog? </h3>

<h5> 
1. Well I know how to play two instruments. The clarinet and the alto saxophone. I played these two from grade school all the way through high school! I was in every band you could think of: Marching band, Symphonic band, Jazz band, Pep band etc!
2. I love everything that can be turned into an art. whether it is fashion, crafts, or cooking/baking. 
3. Another fun fact about me is I love love love to travel. It is my Love language to myself! </h5>


<h2> Week 2! </h2>

<h3> What is something you wish you could do but currently do not have the coding skills to accomplish? </h3>
<h5> There's alot I wish I knew more of when it comes to coding. After this week with the webpage, I definitely want to get comfortable with using html and css and if I get stuck, I want to be able to know where exactly to go to help me get through a situation. </h5>

<h3> What am I struggling with?<h/3>
<h5> I am currently struggling with not being overwhelmed with all the new information that I'm learning. It is super confusing at first, but after some practice of using it and getting used to the techniques more, I should be fine.</h5>

<h3> How do you solve a problem? </h3>
<h5> Majority of the time I really just need to slow down. I get ahead of myself and get in my head. I take a lot of breaks in between time. I go back and look at other peoples codes or even try to understand it more with examples from google, etc. I reach out to other classmates and my instructor. </h5>

<h3> What methods do you use to help yourself get unstuck? </h3>
<h5> I go back and look over my work to see what I've done. Reading the material first hand doesn't really help me much. It's kind of like I'm reading a bunch a matrial and have no idea what I'm reading. So I reread the material again as I go through the problems and by doing it makes more sense that way to me. Of course I reach out to my instructor and classmates as well!</h5>

<h2>Week 3! </h2>

<h3> What are your thoughts about the roles HTML, CSS, and JavaScript play in the process of rendering content and providing a user experience? </h3>
<h5> My thoughts on HTMl, CSS is pretty okay at the moment. JavaScript is still a little all over the place with the number of functions and information that comes with it. The key points is that I do know that HTML is the content of the webpage. CSS is the style and layout of the webpage. JavaScript is to program the behavior of the web page. It's just a matter of getting more comfortable with all of the information that comes with all three.</h5>

<h3> What are some objects that your blog incorporates? </h3>
<h5> I do not currently have any at the moment. I plan on adding CSS and JavaScript into my blog over time and playing around with the functions. </h5>
