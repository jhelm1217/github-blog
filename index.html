    <h2>Week 1!</h2>
    <h3> Was your first week what you expected? Why or why not? </h3>
    <p> Honestly, yes, I knew for a fact that I was going to experience 18 different emotions in a day! LOL. The material was going to be a bit challenging, but I knew with patience and staying gentle with myself throughout this journey, I would be fine. I'm used to not asking for help, so this is really making me step out of my comfort zone. <pp>
    <p> I'm actually eager to learn just about everything. I love the CSS and styling, that looks pretty fun so I want to learn more about that. Since I am fairly new to , I would like to see which section I would like more than the others, such as front end, back end etc. </p>
    <h3> What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog? </h3>
    <p> 
     <li>Well I know how to play two instruments. The clarinet and the alto saxophone. I played these two from grade school all the way through high school! I was in every band you could think of: Marching band, Symphonic band, Jazz band, Pep band etc!</li>
     <li>I love everything that can be turned into an art. whether it is fashion, crafts, or cooking/baking. </li>
     <li>Another fun fact about me is I love love love to travel. It is my Love language to myself!</li></p>

    <h2> Week 2! </h2>
    <h3> What is something you wish you could do but currently do not have the coding skills to accomplish? </h3>
     <p> There's alot I wish I knew more of when it comes to coding. After this week with the webpage, I definitely want to get comfortable with using html and css and if I get stuck, I want to be able to know where exactly to go to help me get through a situation. </p>
    <h3> What am I struggling with?</h3>
     <p> I am currently struggling with not being overwhelmed with all the new information that I'm learning. It is super confusing at first, but after some practice of using it and getting used to the techniques more, I should be fine.</p>
    <h3> How do you solve a problem? </h3>
     <p> Majority of the time I really just need to slow down. I get ahead of myself and get in my head. I take a lot of breaks in between time. I go back and look at other peoples codes or even try to understand it more with examples from google, etc. I reach out to other classmates and my instructor. </p>
    <h3> What methods do you use to help yourself get unstuck? </h3>
     <p> I go back and look over my work to see what I've done. Reading the material first hand doesn't really help me much. It's kind of like I'm reading a bunch a matrial and have no idea what I'm reading. So I reread the material again as I go through the problems and by doing it makes more sense that way to me. Of course I reach out to my instructor and classmates as well!</p>

    <h2>Week 3! </h2>
    <h3> What are your thoughts about the roles HTML, CSS, and JavaScript play in the process of rendering content and providing a user experience? </h3>
     <p> My thoughts on HTMl, CSS is pretty okay at the moment. JavaScript is still a little all over the place with the number of functions and information that comes with it. The key points is that I do know that HTML is the content of the webpage. CSS is the style and layout of the webpage. JavaScript is to program the behavior of the web page. It's just a matter of getting more comfortable with all of the information that comes with all three.</p>
    <h3> What are some objects that your blog incorporates? </h3>
      <p>I had fun with this week's blog submission. I accidentally deleted my blog, don't ask me how lol. but in doing so, it allowed me to play around a little more with HTML and CSS!! I am very confident in my blog this week! I am still learning the functions and how JavaScript works. So hopefully by next week, I will have a full and better understanding of Javascript and start adding that into my blog! </p>

      <h2> Week 4!</h2>
      <h3>What was helpful during Onboarding working remotely?</h3>
        <p>I would have to say that being in the comfort of my home and not being micro managed helped. I'm not too fond of being in one place for long periods of time. So the ability to have some sort of freedom really allowed me to be sucessful. I can take a quick nap, cook, watch tv, and still have time to finish my work. </p>
      <h3>What hindered your progress during Onboarding?</h3>
        <p>I would have to say, even though the curriculum is well structured, having a lot of new information thrown out at once was overwhelming. </p>
      <h3>How did you overcome challenges during Onboarding?</h3>
      <p>It was really having to shift my mindset that helped me. I was intimidated in the beginning because I felt like I'm one of the few who doesn't have a background at all in programming. After Learning some of the material, I was able to retain it and I noticed my progress from week 1. I tell myself, "It is not hard, yes it can be challenging, but it's just new." </p>

      <h2>Spint 1!</h2>
      <h3>what is the number one thing that held you back this week? Why?</h3>
      <p> I would have to say that my focus was off a little this week, due to personal issues, family issues etc. I need to create a balance between everything and make sure that myself and school comes first.</p>
      <h3>What is one thing you would like to learn more about regarding JavaScript?</h3>
      <p>I would like to understand and be able to comprehend the language, Bootstrap, everything, a little bit more. I want to learn and be able to know where to go to find the answer I need. Such as which functions to use for certain questions. As well as thoroughly understanding what each does without confusion. </p>
      <p>I even downloaded a coding app for extra help that will go over the same material as in class. It has interactive questions that are either refreshers for me or just something I might've missed that is helping me connect the dots.</p>
